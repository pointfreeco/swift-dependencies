/// Propagates the current dependencies to an escaping context.
///
/// This helper takes a trailing closure that is provided an ``DependencyValues/Continuation``
/// value, which can be used to access dependencies in an escaped context. It is useful in
/// situations where you cannot leverage structured concurrency and must use escaping closures.
/// Dependencies do not automatically propagate across escaping boundaries like they do in
/// structured contexts and in `Task`s.
///
/// For example, suppose you want to use `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` to execute some logic after
/// a delay, and that logic needs to make use of dependencies. In order to guarantee that
/// dependencies used in the escaping closure of `asyncAfter` reflect the correct values, you should
/// use `withEscapedDependencies`:
///
/// ```swift
/// withEscapedDependencies { dependencies in
///   DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {
///     dependencies.yield {
///       // All code in here will use dependencies at the time of calling withEscapedDependencies.
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// As a general rule, you should surround _all_ escaping code that may access dependencies with
/// this helper, and you should use ``DependencyValues/Continuation/yield(_:)-42ttb`` _immediately_
/// inside the escaping closure. Otherwise you run the risk of the escaped code using the wrong
/// dependencies. But, you should also try your hardest to keep your code in the structured world
/// using Swift's tools of structured concurrency, and should avoid using escaping closures.
///
/// If you need to further override dependencies in the escaped closure, do so inside the
/// ``DependencyValues/Continuation/yield(_:)-42ttb`` and not outside:
///
/// ```swift
/// withEscapedDependencies { dependencies in
///   DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {
///     dependencies.yield {
///       withDependencies {
///         $0.apiClient = .mock
