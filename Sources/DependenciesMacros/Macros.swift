/// Improves the ergonomics of dependency clients modeled on structs and closures, as detailed in
/// our ["Designing Dependencies"][designing-dependencies] article.
///
/// To use the macro, simply apply it to the struct interface of your dependency:
///
/// ```swift
/// import DependenciesMacros
///
/// @DependencyClient
/// struct APIClient {
///   var fetchUser: (Int) async throws -> User
///   var saveUser: (User) async throws -> Void
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This adds a number of things to your dependency client types.
///
/// First of all, it provides a default, "unimplemented" value for all of the closure endpoints that
/// do not have one by applying the ``DependencyEndpoint(method:)`` macro. This means you get a very
/// lightweight way to create an instance of this interface:
///
/// ```swift
/// let unimplementedClient = APIClient()
/// ```
///
/// This is a very special implementation of the client. If you invoke any endpoint on this instance
/// it will also cause a test failure when run in tests, and if the endpoint is throwing, it will
/// throw an error. This serves as the perfect client to use as the `testValue` of your
/// dependencies:
///
/// ```swift
/// extension APIClient: TestDependencyKey {
///   static let testValue = APIClient()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This makes it so that while testing your feature, if an execution flow ever uses an endpoint
/// that you did not explicitly override in the test, a failure will be triggered. Manually
/// maintaining an unimplemented client can be laborious, but now the macro provides one to you for
/// free.
///
/// Second, the macro will generate methods with named arguments for any of your closure endpoints
/// that have tuple argument labels. This is done by applying the ``DependencyEndpoint(method:)``
/// macro to each closure property, so read the documentation for that macro for more
/// detailed information.
///
/// As an example, if you change the above `APIClient` like so:
///
/// ```diff
///  @DependencyClient
///  struct APIClient {
/// -  var fetchUser: (Int) async throws -> User
/// +  var fetchUser: (_ id: Int) async throws -> User
///    var saveUser: (User) async throws -> Void
///  }
/// ```
///
/// â€¦then a method `fetchUser(id:)` is automatically added to the client:
///
/// ```swift
/// let client = APIClient()
///
/// let user = try await client.fetchUser(id: 42)
/// ```
///
/// This fixes one of the biggest problems of dealing with struct interfaces for dependencies, and
/// that is the loss of argument labels.
///
/// And finally, it generates a public initializer for all of the endpoints automatically:
///
/// ```swift
/// let liveClient = APIClient(
///   fetchUser: { id in â€¦ },
///   saveUser: { user in â€¦ }
/// )
/// ```
///
/// This is particularly useful when modularizing your dependencies (as explained
/// [here][separating-interface-implementation]) as you will need a public initializer to create
/// instances of the client. Creating that initializer manually is quite laborious, and you have to
/// update it each time a new endpoint is added to the client.
///
/// ## Restrictions
///
/// Usage of the ``DependencyClient()`` macro does have a restriction to be aware of. If your
/// client has a closure that is non-throwing and non-void returning like below, then you
/// will get a compile-time error letting you know a default must be provided:
///
/// ```swift
/// @DependencyClient
/// struct APIClient {
///   // ðŸ›‘ Default value required for non-throwing closure 'isFavorite'
///   var isFavorite: () -> Bool
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The error also comes with a helpful fix-it to let you know what needs to be done:
///
/// ```swift
/// @DependencyClient
/// struct APIClient {
///   var isFavorite: () -> Bool = { <#Bool#> }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The reason we require a default for these endpoints is so that you immediately get access to
/// a default client via `APIClient()`, which is handy to use in tests and SwiftUI previews. The
/// only way to do this, without crashing at runtime, is if you provide defaults for your endpoints.
///
/// To fix you must supply a closure that returns a default value. The default value can be anything
/// and does not need to signify a real value. For example, if the endpoint returns a boolean, you
/// can return `false`, or if it returns an array, you can return `[]`.`

/// Provides a default, "unimplemented" value to a closure property.
///
/// This macro is automatically applied to all closure properties of a struct annotated with
/// ``DependencyClient``.
///
/// If an "unimplemented" closure is invoked and not overridden, a test failure will be emitted, and
/// the endpoint will throw an error if it is a throwing closure.
///
/// If the closure this macro is applied to provides argument labels for the input tuple, then a
/// corresponding method will also be generated with named labels. For example, this:
///
/// ```swift
/// @DependencyEndpoint
/// var fetchUser: (_ id: User.ID) async throws -> User
/// ```
///
/// â€¦expands to this:
///
/// ```swift
/// var fetchUser: (_ id: User.ID) async throws -> User
/// func fetchUser(id: User.ID) async throws -> User {
///   try await self.fetchUser(id)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now you can use a clearer syntax at the call site of invoking this endpoint:
///
/// ```swift
/// let client = APIClient()
/// let user = try await client.fetchUser(id: 42)
/// ```
///
/// You can also modify the name of the generated method, which can be handy for creating overloaded
/// method names:
///
/// ```swift
/// @DependencyEndpoint(method: "fetchUser")
/// var fetchUserByID: (_ id: User.ID) async throws -> User
/// @DependencyEndpoint(method: "fetchUser")
/// var fetchUserBySubscriptionID: (_ subscriptionID: Subscription.ID) async throws -> User
/// ```
///
/// This expands to:
///
/// ```swift
/// var fetchUserByID: (_ id: User.ID) async throws -> User
/// func fetchUser(id: User.ID) async throws -> User {
///   self.fetchUserByID(id)
/// }
/// var fetchUserBySubscriptionID: (_ subscriptionID: Subscription.ID) async throws -> User
/// func fetchUser(subscriptionID: Subscription.ID) async throws -> User {
///   self.fetchUserBySubscriptionID(subscriptionID)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now you can have an overloaded version of `fetchUser` that takes different arguments:
///
/// ```swift
/// let client = APIClient()
/// let user1 = try await client.fetchUser(id: 42)
/// let user2 = try await client.fetchUser(subscriptionID: "sub_deadbeef")
/// ```
